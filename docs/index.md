   - Utilizes byte-range requests (`Range` headers) for partial audio downloads, reducing bandwidth usage.
   - Ensures smooth playback even in low-bandwidth conditions.

2. **Offline and Background Playback**
   - Tracks can be downloaded and played offline, stored securely using `expo-file-system`.
   - Background playback is integrated with system-level media controls for uninterrupted listening.

3. **Dynamic UI with Animations**
   - **Reanimated 3** powers animations like shared transitions, progress bars, and tooltips.
   - **Rive** adds visual appeal with state-based animations for toggles and interactive elements.

4. **Advanced Analytics System**
   - Modular analytics framework supports Firebase Analytics and custom adapters.
   - Tracks user interactions, downloads, and playback for actionable insights.

5. **Robust and Scalable Architecture**
   - Modularized React Native components allow for rapid feature extension.
   - Shared values ensure efficient state management without overloading React's render cycle.
