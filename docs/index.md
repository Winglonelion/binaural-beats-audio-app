## **Technical Features**

### **Frontend (React Native)**

#### **1. Efficient Audio Streaming**
   - Implements byte-range requests using `Range` headers to enable partial audio downloads.
   - Optimized for low-latency playback even with high-resolution audio files.
   - Reduces bandwidth usage by downloading only the required segments of the audio file during playback.

#### **2. Offline and Background Playback**
   - Audio files can be downloaded and stored securely using **expo-file-system**.
   - Background playback is enabled via Expo's media controls, allowing users to play/pause/seek audio even when the app is minimized.

#### **3. Dynamic and Interactive UI**
   - Smooth and responsive animations powered by **Reanimated 3**, providing:
     - Shared transitions between UI states (e.g., Quick Player to Full Player).
     - Progress bars and sliders with real-time feedback using shared values.
   - **Rive** animations for micro-reactions, such as toggle buttons and visual indicators, improving user engagement.

#### **4. Advanced Analytics System**
   - Modularized analytics framework supports Firebase Analytics and custom adapters.
   - Tracks user behavior such as audio playback, downloads, and UI interactions.
   - Easily extensible for adding new analytics providers or custom metrics.

#### **5. Robust and Scalable Architecture**
   - Modular React Native components ensure easy extension and maintenance.
   - State management optimized using shared values to reduce unnecessary re-renders.

### **Backend (Golang)**

#### **1. Audio Streaming with Metadata**
   - RESTful API serves audio files with `Range` header support for efficient streaming.
   - Additional metadata (e.g., title, author, duration) is provided alongside audio files.

#### **2. Optimized Performance**
   - Built using the **Gin** framework, running in `release` mode for maximum performance.
   - Implements concurrent request handling and byte-range support for large-scale streaming.

#### **3. Extensible Design**
   - Metadata and audio files are organized for efficient retrieval and management.
   - Supports horizontal scaling via Docker containers, ensuring the system can handle thousands of users simultaneously.

#### **4. Secure Offline Downloads**
   - Metadata and download management integrated with client apps for secure and consistent offline playback.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Frontend Setup**

#### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js and Yarn installed on your system.
- Expo CLI for running the app.

#### **Steps**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Winglonelion/binaural-beats-audio-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd binaural-beats-audio-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   yarn pod
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

5. **Run the application on iOS**:
   ```bash
   yarn ios
   ```

6. **Run the application on Android**:
   ```bash
   yarn android
   ```

#### **Optional**
To enable offline mode, ensure your backend API is accessible by replacing `localhost` with the server IP in the frontend code.

For more detailed information, please read [Frontend README](https://github.com/Winglonelion/binaural-beats-audio-app)

### **Backend Setup**

#### **Prerequisites**
- Go installed (version 1.21 or later).
- Docker installed for containerized deployment.

#### **Steps**

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Winglonelion/binaural-beats-audio-services.git
cd binaural-beats-audio-services
```

**2. Quick start server with Docker**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

**3. Install dependencies**

Dependencies are managed via `go.mod`. Run the following command to ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

**4. Run the server**

Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   The server will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

**5. API Endpoints**:

- `GET /api/audio` - Returns a list of available audio files.
- `GET /api/audio/{file_name}` - Streams the selected audio file.
- `GET /api/download/{file_name}` - Downloads the audio file.


For more detailed information, please read [Backend README](https://github.com/Winglonelion/binaural-beats-audio-services)



## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Caching Mechanisms**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed audio files to reduce server load.

2. **Improved Offline Analytics**:
   - Cache user activity data offline and sync with the backend when the device reconnects.

3. **Personalized Recommendations**:
   - Use machine learning to suggest audio tracks based on user behavior and preferences.

4. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - Extend compatibility to web and desktop platforms for a unified experience.
